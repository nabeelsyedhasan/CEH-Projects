# CEH-Projects

Welcome to my **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) Projects** repository!

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I prepare for the CEH certification. Here, I will showcase practical penetration testing projects, including tools, methodologies, and vulnerability write-ups. The projects include a range of assessments and tasks aimed at strengthening my skills in ethical hacking and cybersecurity.
